    <h1>Maryland</h1>
    <p>Maryland has 41 miles of trail that mostly runs along the ridge of South Mountain. By AT standards it is relatively flat and some thru-hikers complete it in one day.
        I did the Maryland section over 3 days in 2011 on my first ever backpacking trip!

    <p>Unfortunately my pictures from this trip have gone missing!  Check back later in case I find them.</p>
